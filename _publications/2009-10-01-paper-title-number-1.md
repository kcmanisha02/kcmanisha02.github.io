excerpt: 'This paper highlights promoting sustainable biogas production in Nepal could replace LPG gas and solid biomass, reduce emissions, and lower household air pollution. Through a comprehensive district-level assessment, we have estimated an annual biogas production of 4412 million m3 from various waste biomass sources. Nepal could realize these benefits by accounting for spatial variation in biogas production potential. However, a cautionary note, there are concerns about the current policy landscape, implementation mechanism, and monitoring and evaluation modality.'
